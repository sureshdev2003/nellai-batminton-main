## Database Structure

### Admin Logs Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE admin_logs (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    admin_id INT NOT NULL,
    admin_username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    action VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    booking_id INT,
    booking_type ENUM('daily', 'monthly') NULL,
    old_status VARCHAR(20),
    new_status VARCHAR(20),
    details TEXT,
    ip_address VARCHAR(45),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (admin_id) REFERENCES admins(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

3. **Admin Action**: Admin clicks "Approve" or "Reject"
4. **Status Update**: Booking moves to appropriate tab
5. **Logging**: Action is logged with full details

### 2. **Admin Activity Logging**
- **Action Tracking**: Every approve/reject action is logged
- **Details Captured**: 
  - Admin ID and username
  - Booking ID and type
  - Old and new status
  - Detailed description
  - IP address
  - Timestamp

### 3. **Tab System**
- **Pending Tab**: Only shows bookings with status 'pending'
- **Approved Tab**: Only shows bookings with status 'approved'
- **Rejected Tab**: Only shows bookings with status 'rejected'
- **Dynamic Counts**: Tab buttons show real-time counts
